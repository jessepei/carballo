Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
carballo,org.vectomatic.svg.chess,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ChessConstants; ChessMode; Main; ChessBoard; ChessCss; Resources; MoveListener]; [Main.MainBinder]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.25
carballo,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 6.38.
